# Library Management System (LMS)

## Pre-requisite and Installation
- Download and install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Install other python dependencies for this project -> Flask, flask-restx, flask-restful, flask-cors, flasgger, requests.
- The above dependencies can be installed using requirements.txt.
- ### requirements.txt
  ```sh
  Flask
  flask-restx
  flask-restful
  flask-cors
  flasgger
  requests
  ```
- ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- You can also install the above dependencies separately from the command line using pip using the following commands instead of the above requirements.txt file.
- ```sh
  pip install Flask
  pip install flask-restx
  pip install flask-restful
  pip install flask-cors
  pip install flasgger
  pip install requests
  ```
- Note: sqlite3 and unittest are part of the Python Standard Library and hence does not need to be installed separately with pip.
